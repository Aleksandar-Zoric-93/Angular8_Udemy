### The main benefits of using Angular in web applications
* Angular modifies the page DOM directly instead of adding inner HTML code which is faster.
* Data binding does not occur on each control or value change (no change listeners) but at particular points of the JavaScript code execution. That dramatically improves performance, as a single bulk Model/View update replaces hundreds of cascading data change events.
* There is no need to use observable functions. Angular analyzes the page DOM and builds the bindings based on the Angular-specific element attributes. That requires less writing, meaning the code is cleaner, easier to understand, and has fewer errors.
* Extended features such as dependency injection, routing, animations, view encapsulation, and more are available.
* It is supported by IntelliJ IDEA and Visual Studio .NET IDEs.
* It is supported by Google and a great development community.
* Angular is a comprehensive solution for rapid front-end development. It does not need any other plugins or frameworks.
* Angular is unit testing ready, and that is one of its most compelling advantages.
