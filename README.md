### The main benefits of using Angular in web applications are
Angular modifies the page DOM directly instead of adding inner HTML code which is faster.
Data binding does not occur on each control or value change (no change listeners) but at particular points of the JavaScript code execution. That dramatically improves performance, as a single bulk Model/View update replaces hundreds of cascading data change events.

There is no need to use observable functions. Angular analyzes the page DOM and builds the bindings based on the Angular-specific element attributes. That requires less writing, meaning the code is cleaner, easier to understand, and has fewer errors.
Extended features such as dependency injection, routing, animations, view encapsulation, and more are available.
It is supported by IntelliJ IDEA and Visual Studio .NET IDEs.
It is supported by Google and a great development community.
Angular is a comprehensive solution for rapid front-end development. It does not need any other plugins or frameworks.
Angular is unit testing ready, and that is one of its most compelling advantages.
